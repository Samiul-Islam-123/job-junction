* **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client

**Backend:**

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment
* **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js
* **MongoDB:** NoSQL database
* **Mongoose:** Object Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB

**Structure:**

* `eslint.config.js`: Configuration for ESLint, a code linter
* `index.html`: Main HTML file
* `package-lock.json`: Dependencies and their versions
* `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies
* `postcss.config.js`: Configuration for PostCSS, a CSS processor
* `public/`: Static files for the frontend
    * `vite.svg`: Vite logo for the homepage
* `README.md`: Documentation for the frontend
* `src/`: Source code for the frontend
    * `App.css`: Main CSS file for the frontend
    * `App.jsx`: Main component of the frontend
    * `assets/`: Assets used in the frontend
    * `components/`: Reusable components for the frontend

    * `main.jsx`: Entry point for the frontend
    * `privatePages/`: Components for private pages, requiring authentication
    * `publicPages/`: Components for public pages
    * `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS
    * `vite.config.js`: Configuration for Vite

**Backend:**

* `.env`: Environment variables for development and production
* `Config/`: Configuration files
    * `db_config.js`: Configuration for connecting to MongoDB
* `controllers/`: Controllers for handling requests and responses
    * `userController.js`: Controller for user-related operations
* `index.js`: Entry point for the backend
* `models/`: Models for representing data in the database
    * `UserModel.js`: Model for user data
* `package-lock.json`: Dependencies and their versions
* `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies
* `routes/`: Routers for defining API endpoints
    * `userRouter.js`: Router for user-related API endpoints
* `README.md`: Documentation for the backend

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and set the following environment variables:
    * `MONGO_URI`: Connection string for your MongoDB instance
    * `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication
4. Run the backend server: `npm start`.
5. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies: `npm install`.
6. Run the frontend development server: `npm run dev`.

**Features:**

* **Job Search:** Users can search for jobs based on keywords, location, and other criteria.
* **Job Application Management:** Users can track their applications, view job details, and manage their job search progress.
